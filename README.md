# Cyclic-Redundancy-Check
This repository contains an implementation of the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithm, a widely-used error-detection technique in data communication and storage systems. The CRC algorithm generates a checksum for a given data block to detect accidental changes or corruption during transmission.
